# Recycling Buddy

This is the Senior Project for my Computer Science major in the Ameriacn University in Bulgaria.  
I chose this topic and crafted this application in an attempt to make information about recycling more understandable and accessible.

“Recycling buddy” uses key properties of image classification and image recognition. It employs the phone camera to analyze different waste objects and classify them into four main groups: Paper, Plastic, Glass, Metal, and one additional generalized "Trash" group. Each group has been trained with hundreds of images, then validated using TensorFlow technologies. The application was developed in Android Studio, using TensorFlow to generate the models.
