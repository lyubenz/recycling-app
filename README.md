# Recycling Buddy

This is my Senior Project for the completion of my Computer Science major in the Ameriacn University in Bulgaria.  
I created this application to make information about recycling more understandable and accessible.

“Recycling buddy” uses key properties of image classification and image recognition. It employs the phone camera to analyze different waste objects and classify them into four main groups: Paper, Plastic, Glass and Metal. Each group has been trained with hundreds of images, then validated using TensorFlow technologies. The application was developed in Android Studio, using TensorFlow to generate the models.
